1. What are the three stages to build the hypotheses or model in machine learning?
Ans: 1: Select Data
     2: Preprocess Data
     3: Transform Data

2. What is the standard approach to supervised learning?
Ans: Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired
output is known.The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the
algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. It then modifies the model
accordingly.

3. What is Training set and Test set?
Ans: In machine learning, a training set is a dataset used to train a model. In training the model, specific features
are picked out from the training set. These features are then incorporated into the model. Thereby, if the
training set is labeled correctly, the model should be able to learn something from these features.

The test set is a dataset used to measure how well the model performs at making predictions on that test set.
If the prediction scores for the test set are unreasonable, weâ€™ll need to make some adjustments to our model
and try again.

4. What is the general principle of an ensemble method and what is bagging and
boosting in ensemble method?
Ans: The general principle of an ensemble method is to combine the predictions of several models built with a given 
learning algorithm in order to improve robustness over a single model. 
Bagging is a method in ensemble for improving unstable estimation or classification schemes.

5. How can you avoid overfitting ?
Ans: Overfitting can be avoided by cross valdiation. Cross-validation is a resampling procedure 
used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.
